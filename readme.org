* Mouse and Keyboard
** Unbinding system shortcuts that don't appear in the GNOME ~Settings~ app.
At some point ~C-e~, ~C-S-e~, and ~C-S-u~ got hijacked[1] by the system for an emoji picker. Fortunately we can disable it without too much effort.
#+BEGIN_SRC
ibus-setup # Emoji -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> (Emoji Annotation & Unicode Code point) -> Delete
#+END_SRC

I also had to dissable the ~org.freedesktop.ibus.panel.emoji~ hotkey with ~gsettings~ to get ~C-e~ back.
#+BEGIN_SRC
gsettings set org.freedesktop.ibus.panel.emoji hotkey []
#+END_SRC

** Mouse Button Configuration
GNOME and Wayland have changed how input devices are configured. No
more ~xinput~ or ~setxkbmap~. The "new" way is to use ~hwdb~. It works
well once you figure it out.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
apt install libinput-tools evtest
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ cat /etc/udev/hwdb.d/99-Mouse-Buttons.hwdb
# TO APPLY CHANGES
# systemd-hwdb update
# udevadm trigger
#

# Remap any Forward / Back buttons to be middle click
evdev:*
  KEYBOARD_KEY_90004=btn_middle
  KEYBOARD_KEY_90005=btn_middle

# Or target a specific device like:
# evdev:name:Logitech M570:*

#+END_SRC

We can enable scroll wheel emulation on GNOME+Wayland through ~gsettings~.
(The middle mouse button is usually ~2~)
#+BEGIN_SRC text
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.trackball scroll-wheel-emulation-button <button_id>
#+END_SRC
